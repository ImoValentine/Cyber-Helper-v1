üß† App Description:
Cyber Helper is an AI-assisted tool designed for cybersecurity analysts. It helps interpret and resolve system error codes by leveraging multiple AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Huggiface). These agents discuss the error internally, share their opinions, and attempt to reach a consensus or provide multiple solutions when no agreement is reached. The final analysis is presented to the user in a clear, concise format to assist in incident response or system troubleshooting.

üß∞ Tech Stack:
‚Ä¢	Backend: AWS Lambda (serverless logic), Amazon API Gateway (API endpoints)
‚Ä¢	Database: Amazon DynamoDB
‚Ä¢	AI Services: OpenAI, Groq, others (optional)
‚Ä¢	Frontend: React.js
‚Ä¢	Hosting: AWS Amplify Hosting

üìå Project Scope and Development Plan
Phase 1: Setup & Backend (AWS Lambda + DynamoDB)
1.	Create DynamoDB Table:
o	Set up ErrorLogs table with attributes:
ÔÇß	id (String, Primary Key)
ÔÇß	timestamp (String)
ÔÇß	errorCode (String)
ÔÇß	aiResponses (Map/JSON String)
ÔÇß	resolutionSummary (String)
2.	Lambda Function (handleErrorCode):
o	Receives error code from API Gateway.
o	Calls AI APIs (OpenAI, etc.)
o	Collates and processes AI responses.
o	Stores results in DynamoDB.
o	Returns AI responses and resolution summary.
3.	API Gateway:
o	Set up a POST endpoint /error that triggers the Lambda function.
o	Ensure CORS is enabled for frontend interaction.
________________________________________
Phase 2: Frontend (React App)
1.	Input Form:
o	Text input for error code
o	Submit button
o	Loading indicator
2.	Display Results:
o	Summary of each AI‚Äôs interpretation
o	Final agreed (or most reliable) resolution
o	Differences in opinion (if applicable)
3.	Styling:
o	Use Tailwind CSS or simple CSS modules or Bootstrap
o	Optional: Light/Dark mode toggle
________________________________________
Phase 3: API Integration
1.	AI API Communication:
o	Use axios or fetch to call OpenAI, Groq, etc.
o	Design prompt structure to elicit technical, concise diagnoses.
2.	Simulate AI ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù:
o	Chain responses:
ÔÇß	AI 1 responds
ÔÇß	AI 2 reads AI 1‚Äôs opinion and replies
ÔÇß	AI 3 attempts consensus
o	Return all AI feedback in structured JSON
3.	Output to User:
o	Clear, human-readable explanation
o	Optional: Add links to relevant docs or tips
o	Include a button to report incorrect analysis
________________________________________
Phase 4: Deployment & Extras
1.	Deploy Frontend (Amplify Hosting):
o	Use AWS Amplify to host and deploy the React app
2.	Testing:
o	Use Postman or Thunder Client to test API Gateway endpoint
o	Verify end-to-end functionality
3.	(Post-Hackathon Extras):
o	Supabase Auth ‚Üí Replace with Cognito for login
o	Analytics dashboard for error/code trends
o	Feedback collection to refine AI model selection
o	Slack/Email alerts for specific codes or events

üéØ Hackathon Focus:
‚Ä¢	Functional Core: Working prototype over polish
‚Ä¢	Rapid Development: Leverage AWS services for speed
‚Ä¢	Clear Data Flow: Frontend ‚Üî API Gateway ‚Üî Lambda ‚Üî DynamoDB
‚Ä¢	AI Integration: Ensure accurate and well-formatted model responses
‚ÄÉ
‚Ä¢	COME BACK TO SMART CONCENSUS LOGIC!

‚Ä¢	Consensus Logic in Cyber Helper
The Cyber Helper app implements consensus logic to combine responses from three AI models (HuggingFace, Groq, Gemini) into a unified resolution summary. It extracts explanations and resolution steps from each AI, identifies steps agreed upon by at least two AIs, and generates a summary with the shared explanation and steps. This approach improves reliability by focusing on agreed-upon solutions, enhances user experience with concise instructions, and builds trust by showing AI consensus. For example, for ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT, the logic identifies common steps like "Check your internet connection" and "Clear your browser cache," presenting them in a clear, numbered list.

Lots of potential- real world use cases. Users of multiple AI‚Äôs can just use this platform- can be configured etc.. SaaS- rent

Free Security Options on AWS:
‚Ä¢	HTTPS by Default: Amplify already provides free SSL/TLS certificates via AWS Certificate Manager, so your app is secure in transit.
‚Ä¢	Basic Access Control: 
-	You can password-protect your app in Amplify for free. Go to the "Access control" settings in the Amplify Console and enable password protection for your staging or production branch. This restricts access to only those with the password (useful for a hackathon demo).
‚Ä¢	Secure Code Practices: 
-	Ensure your frontend code doesn‚Äôt expose sensitive data (e.g., API keys). Use environment variables in Amplify to store secrets (free feature).
‚Ä¢	AWS Shield (Free Tier): 
-	AWS Shield Standard is automatically enabled for all AWS customers at no cost. It provides basic DDoS protection for your Amplify app.
‚Ä¢	Avoid Unnecessary Features: 
-	Skip the Amplify Firewall/WAF for now since it‚Äôs not free. Your app is likely low-risk for a hackathon, and HTTPS + Shield Standard should suffice.
